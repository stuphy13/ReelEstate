This repository contains a beginner-friendly machine learning project where I practice and implement linear and polynomial regression from scratch, Without using Scikit-Learn. The goal is to predict house prices using a real-world dataset.



### **Objectives**

* To practice Data Pre-processing.
* Learn to visualize data using Matplotlib.
* Data handling using Pandas.
* Understanding how the linear regression actually works. (Without using Scikit-Learn)
* Practice Gradient descent algorithm.



### Tools Used

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
